## Hi, this is me

I'm a young aspiring software-engineer who's passion is writing high quality code. I love takeling highly complex tasks and breaking them down into small pieces of reusable code.

My other passions include IT-Security, playing and extending Minecraft and making music.

## What I do

I've been building and working on all sorts of web-based applications using PHP for the last few years,
including e-commerce platforms, webservices and payment-integrations.

I'm currently looking into go-lang https://golang.org/ for my private programming adventures.
